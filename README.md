# KaranProjectSolutions
An in-progress compliation of solutions to Karan's Problems. 
Why? Because I wanted to see if I could do most of the problems.
Also, to keep practicing and learning c.

The list of problems can be found [here](https://github.com/karan/Projects)

### How To Run:
1. clone
2. build w/ gcc
3. ./driver

### Current Commands: 
- list-- lists all possible programs available to run
- info \[program name\]-- gives a description of the program
- exit/quit-- exits the program
- \[program name\] - runs the specified program

### //TODO
- makefile
- make Sieve prettier and use bit arrays to use less memory
- view projects by cateogry
- obviously some more solutions. I was thinking Numbers next

## Solutions
List of all current solutions sorted by category
### Classic Algorithms
- Collatz Conjecture (6/28/17)
- Sieve of Eratosthenes (7/12/17)
